          "text": "üí° Mini-Lesson: Useful Array methods in JavaScript<p>JavaScript arrays are more powerful than most beginners realize. Methods like <code>.map()</code>, <code>.filter()</code>, and <code>.reduce()</code> can completely change how you handle data. Instead of writing long loops, you can perform transformations, filter results, and calculate totals in just a few lines of clean code.</p><p>For example, <code>.map()</code> allows you to quickly transform each element in an array, while <code>.filter()</code> helps you pick only the values you need. Want to get fancy? <code>.reduce()</code> lets you build something entirely new from your array ‚Äî like summing values or grouping data. Mastering these will not only save you time but also make your code more professional and maintainable.</p>",
